----PETER MORIARTY CODE PORTFOLIO----
Here is a short description of each project. Before each name, there is either
(1133) or (1933) which denotes which class I wrote the code for. (1133) stands
for CSCI 1133 which is an introductory Python programming course that I took in
the Fall of '20. (1933) stands for CSCI 1933 which is an introductory algorithms
and data structures class taught in Java.
1--(1133) Lander Game. This was my final programming project for CSCI 1133. I
did this project by myself with fairly little school guidance. This project
showcases some of my skills with object oriented programming and python I/O.
2--(1933) Binary Tree Methods. This was a lab project I did in the Spring of 2021
for CSCI 1933 with one other lab partner. The project includes a generic Node
class and a Binary Tree class with many different methods of printing and 
manipulating a linked-list implementation of binary trees. This project showcases
my skills with linked-lists, binary trees, and Java in general.
3--(1933) Maze Generator. This was a class project I did in the Spring of 2021
for CSCI 1933 with one partner. Of the files in the folder, the only file we 
wrote was "MyMaze.java," where the rest of the stack and queue files being
provided from the course insstructor. This project showcases my skills with 
stack and queue algorithms and Java data structures.
Thank you!
